      <p className="text-lg mb-4">Hi! My name is Paritosh Veer Singh. I am a student at Humber College, passionate about modern web development and always eager to learn new technologies. I enjoy building full-stack applications and exploring frameworks like Next.js.</p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">In this program, I have gained experience with the MERN stack, and this project allowed me to try out server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.</p>
      <p className="text-lg">Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, reading tech blogs, and collaborating on creative projects.</p>
