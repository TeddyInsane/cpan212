## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB running locally
- npm package manager

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd starter_kit/server
npm install
npm start
```
Server runs on: `http://localhost:8001`

### 2. Start the Client (Optional - for testing)
```bash
cd starter_kit/client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Client runs on: `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5174`

### 3. Test the API
- Open browser to client URL
- Test all CRUD operations through the UI
- Or use cURL commands (see server/README.md)
